# Module-Challenge-5

# Overview Analysis 
The purpose and use of this challenge with the Matplotlib was to graph data using the Matplotlib library to create visualization summary charts in a set of data frames.
At the end of the report, the results summarize how the data differs by city type and how those results can be used by businesses for budgeting, planning, etc.

# Results
* Total Rides
The total rides showed urban being the most, surburban being the middle and then rural being in last. This is expected due to population and convenience.

* Total Drivers
The total drivers shares the same relationship with the total rides in terms of urban being the highest. surburban the middle and then rural as last.

* Total Fares 
The total fares from highest to lowest is, Urban, Surburban, and Rural. As this this has to do with customer convenience.

* Average Fare per ride and driver
The highest average fare ride and for drivers is rural and the lowest is urban with suburban as the middle. This is likely due to the landscape structure's distances between locations which can make the price vary from high to low, as rural areas tend to have longer distances between locations and urban areas have more compact locations for better convenience.

# Summary
Some suggestions to improve revenue
1. Surburban seems to have had a good climbing tend in revenue but suddenly plumet to under $1000, and this nearly 2 months later it steadily climbs back to where it was before. This sudden drop should be investigated and promote new ideas increase productivity.
2. The Average Fare per driver also seems to be unbalanced for urban. According to the data, with the rural and suburban having higher averages than the average fare per ride except for urban the Fare per driver seems to be lower than the actual fare ride, this may seem to be as bit of an undercut in payment for drivers since urban areas are much more populated and should revenue just as much for both sides equally without compromising budgeting, funding, etc.
